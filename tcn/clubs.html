						<h2>AGAIN AND AGAIN, YOU PUT THE CROWD IN A SPECIAL KIND OF STATE. WHAT EMOTIONS DO YOU TRY TO EVOKE WHEN YOU MIX?</h2>
						<p>Thank you. I am happy you felt the same way I did that night. It was the 10th anniversary of Underground Quality. Jus-Ed released my first solo record in 2008 so it was a special moment. Good nights are what I live for. And that holds all the more true when I’m playing my own records, I play them first and foremost for myself. I concentrate on one record that I particularly like and I construct my set around that. When it works, the joy is contagious, it explodes through the room. But if you had the idea that I have the secret recipe for a good night, for me it’s a bit more like playing Russian roulette. You never know how it’s going to work. That’s the beauty of it all. There is no script. It’s a complete mystery that depends on the ambience, the sound system and on the ego.
						</p>
						<h2>WHY THE EGO?</h2>
						<p>I think the balance of the ego plays a central role in the creation of an atmosphere which flows smoothly from then on: the crowd, the room and the DJ (who is more of a mediator) are now as one. In that atmosphere which has a certain voodoo about it, choosing records is almost subconscious. Everything just flows perfectly. There’s a powerful and invigorating energy that flies between the DJ and the crowd. It’s a strong connection. The sound spreads through the air with a natural sense of freedom. When I reach that kind of state I feel love, and I want to share my whole world with people. It’s one of the moments when I feel truly happy.
						</p>
						<h2>HOW IS IT THAT PEOPLE FEEL SO SWEPT AWAY?</h2>
						<p>There’s a certain aura around an artist and their performance. It’s important to be a good performer. To put on a good show, good music and virtuosity aren’t enough. The talent of an artist also touches on their ability to create interest and excitement, to keep the crowd’s attention, in a way that’s different from night to night. A performer has to be interesting and charismatic enough to take the crowd away with them in one way or another. They must have a distinctive feature about their DJ set. I know many competent DJs with huge followings, a real devotion to music and great taste, in whom I see nothing extraordinary, in the spiritual sense of the word. Because all they do is play records…

						<h2>HOW CAN YOU MAKE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON FEEL THIS CONNECTION ON THE DANCEFLOOR?</h2>
						<p>I think everybody has something in common. We all want, at least on a subconscious level, to be loved, understood, accepted and we all want to share our experiences with others. For me it’s enough to concentrate on the music I play until I feel something I can share with the public. I’ve noticed that the vibe in a club is largely dependent on the emotions I’m feeling at the time. I like to scan the dancefloor, see people dancing, read what happens when I play a certain mix. To some extent, I stop thinking about what I’m playing. I become a mediator, part of a movement, and all I do is send back the energy.
						</p>
						<h2>THROUGH THE YEARS, YOU HAVE KEPT A VERY SPECIFIC SOUND: ONE THAT IS DARK AND SENSUAL AT THE SAME TIME. WHAT EMOTIONS ARE YOU TRYING TO CONVEY THROUGH YOUR MUSIC?</h2>
						<p>Even if my DJ Kicks mix fits that definition, it still has the feel of a late night radio show, one that works its way slowly into your head. At the end it’s quite trippy and leaves a lot to the imagination. It’s a story that could be interpreted a thousand different ways. So the best thing is to listen and let go.
