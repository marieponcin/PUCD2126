				<p>Arguably the biggest break out techno artist of 2016 and a rising techno starlight, Dax J chatted to Tommy Holohan ahead of his upcoming show at Boxed Off and live set at Hangar.</p>

						<h2>SO FAR 2016 HAS BEEN A MASSIVE YEAR FOR YOU, PLAYING AT AWAKENINGS, BERGHAIN, BRINGING OUT KILLER RELEASES ON MONNOM BLACK & ELECTRIC DELUXE AND DESTROYING PODCASTS LIKE MIXMAG. AN INSIGHT INTO A TYPICAL DAY FOR DAX J?> </h2>
						<p>When I’m not on the road I’m in the studio as much as I can, that’s always my main goal.
						I’m away for days at a time every week so it means I’ve got to make the most of my time when I’m at home and make as much music as possible. I always have a mountain of tasks that need doing, so I never have days off. It’s all good though, I can’t complain, I love being in the studio and I love touring.
						</p>
						<h2>YOU COME FROM A JUNGLE AND DRUM & BASS BACKGROUND WHICH IS EVIDENT IN YOUR SHADES OF BLACK LP. HOW MUCH DOES THIS INFLUENCE YOUR MUSIC SELECTION AND PRODUCTIONS??</h2>
						<p>I think it probably does influence it quite a bit. I don’t put too much thought into it but when I hear tracks with amen breaks or dark heavy bass-lines I’m instantly attracted and my ears perk up. The jungle is a part of my DNA so the influence will always be there!
						</p>
						<h2>HOW DID YOU FIRST GET INVOLVED IN UNDERGROUND MUSIC?</h2>
						<p>TIt all started out when I was at school listening to pirate radios, I was tuning into Drum n Bass pirates, I loved it, was so raw and fresh to my ears, I hadn’t heard anything like it before.
						I was listening to a lot of tapes and recordings from raves also. I had a bit of knowledge at this point and I knew I liked the music, but it wasn’t until around the turn of the millennium when I went to my first rave at Bagleys in Kings Cross and then it all made sense. It was the last piece of the puzzle, I knew right there and then that I wanted to be apart of this underground music. I still cant believe I got into that rave looking back at it now, Nike joggers and a blue YSL shirt. I was so scared of not getting in, being so young, I also wore a whistle round my neck because I thought it would make me look like an “experienced” raver, and the bouncers might think, “yeah he’s done this before, you’re alright, come on in son.”
						Well, in the end I got in, so maybe it did work!

						<h2>WHAT WAS THE IDEA BEHIND STARTING MONNOM BLACK AND WHERE DO YOU SEE IT GOING IN THE FUTURE?</h2>
						<p>Initially it was just to have an outlet to release my own music, soon after the first release I started receiving a lot of great music that I loved, so I had to open it up to everyone because I wanted to put out the music I was getting.
						This year and next I am bringing through new artists and will focus on more label showcases.
						</p>
						<h2>HOW DID IT FEEL TO HAVE TWO TECHNO HEAVYWEIGHTS, DAVE CLARKE AND BEN KLOCK PLAY OUT YOUR TRACKS IN THEIR BBC 1 ESSENTIAL MIX?</h2>
						<p>I grew up with the Essential Mix so to have tracks featured in it by two legends in the game is always very humbling, and an honor.
I’m looking forward to the day when I will be doing my own Essential Mix. Shout out to Pete Tong, I’m ready and waiting!
