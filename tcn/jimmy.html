					<p>Jimmy Edgar is a renaissance man of talent, ideas, and style beyond his years. At 29, the Berlin-based Detroit native with a mischievous mystique has been a prolific artist and musician for two thirds of his enchanted life.</p>
					<p>
					Sonically, he's fluent in a myriad of vernaculars, from "software as music" and glitchy underground Hip Hop to his signature glossy, erotically charged robot funk. Visually, he's established himself as an in-demand director, photographer, and multimedia artist with an impressive roster of videos, exhibits, and magazine work to his credit.</p> 
					<p>
					Born in August of 1983, Edgar was playing drums, keyboards, and saxophone, as well as experimenting with sound manipulation by the time he was an adolescent. To complement to his technical prowess, Edgar learned to play piano and "feel the music" in Detroit's Baptist churches. By the time he was 15, with help from a promoter friend, Edgar was spinning alongside hometown legends Atkins, May, and Saunderson in local strip clubs and raves. His early exposure to music, technology, spirituality, and seduction informed Edgar's creative impulses profoundly, and their confluence has become a recurrent motif in his work.</p>
					<p>
					The tail end of his teen years was a whirlwind of creativity and milestones. In 2002, Germany's Poker Flat released Edgar's single "We Like You.‚Äù On the advice of then employee Travis "Machinedrum" Stewart, Merck released Edgar's My Mines I under one of Edgar's many personas, Kristuit Salu vs Morris Nightingale. My Mines I was hailed by XLR8R as "hip-hop beamed in to deep space." Under the alias Michaux, Edgar dabbled deeper in musical alchemy, releasing 2003's experimental IDM "virus as music" album, %20 on the Dutch label Audio.nl. Referring to the HTML code for an empty space, its title emphasized the impact of silence in music. The resulting frequencies were so intense that the label technically couldn't press it to vinyl, and it became their first and only CD release.</p>
					<p>
					At an age when many artists are just coming into their own, Edgar is more secure in his artistic vision than ever. Most importantly, after years of shape-shifting into others' molds, Jimmy Edgar is now in full control.</p>
