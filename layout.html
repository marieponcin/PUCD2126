<p>Wolfgang Tillmans's pre-Brexit poster campaign has been refreshed ahead of the Dutch general election on March 15, where the possibility of a "Nexit" — the exit of The Netherlands from the European Union — will be pushed by right-wing political parties.</p>

<p>Teaming up with Fantastic Man founders Jop van Bennekom and Gert Jonkers, Tillmans has issued a new set of pro-EU posters, which are available to the public for free from today at Foam Amsterdam, Het Nieuwe Instituut, Witte de With Centre for Contemporary Art, De Balie, and Cookies.</p>

<p>"The EU is not a faceless machine but the representation of 508 million people," the three men say in a statement sent out from Tillmans's studio. "While surely there are still many things to be improved, the core belief in this institution has secured the longest period of inter-European peace and cooperation in history. A democratic conversation between 28 member states is tedious — but it ensures a steady dialog, a constant weighing of the many different demands involved in making each single decision. These processes foster safety and stability, and allow us to call a whole continent something which would otherwise be much smaller: home."</p>

<p>"With an increasing anti-European sentiment it becomes ever so more important to speak out and reinstate the position we believe in. Enraged nationalism is slowly becoming normalized in today's political discourse by far-right politicians. It spews hate and anxiety," the statement continues, concluding, "Cooperation not confrontation. Protect the EU."</p>
