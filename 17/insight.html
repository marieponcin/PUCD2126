					<p>spontaneity [spon-tuh-nee-i-tee, -ney-] : noun, plural spontaneities; 1. the state,
 quality, or fact of being spontaneous; 2. spontaneous activity; 3. spontaneities, spontaneous impulses, movements, or actions. spontaneous [spon-tey-nee-uh s] : adjective; 1.coming or resulting from a natural impulse or tendency -without effort or premeditation- natural and unconstrained -unplanned: a spontaneous burst of applause; 2. (of a person) given to acting upon sudden impulses; 3. (of natural phenomena) arising from internal forces or causes; independent of external agencies; self-acting; 4. growing naturally or without cultivation, as plants and fruits; indigenous; 5.produced by natural process. </p>
	<p>Still now, the meaning of the concept and term spontaneity is very vague in our everyday use, even though it is something we all, as human beings, have experienced and know about. One understands, or thinks, through common sense, basic knowledge and experiences that spontaneity is a human action or reaction which happens without any control and power over it from the person. Spontaneity would be something that « just happens », and a « quality » everyone can acquire or possess. However, the general knowledge is not always the actual truth, which makes it hard to understand what spontaneity is without deeper psychological research. So, what is it exactly? Why aren’t we not all as spontaneous as each other? Does it lead to happiness?  Is spontaneity a way of being free? Research seems to indicate that spontaneity is a human reaction from heredity or that can be affected by the environment, which is not always impulsive or uncontrolled. Spontaneous behavior can have a certain impact on the happiness and success of an individual by heightening his or her sense of freedom and can result in increasing a person’s own well being. Therefore an increased understanding of how it functions should be part of everyone’s life.</p>

<p>So let’s start from the beginning. Spontaneity is the act of being spontaneous. 
Being spontaneous is a characteristic, or a behavior, one can find in a person, which is « its own source », self generated, automatic, without any apparent external cause, « one that occurred without intention, awareness, effort and monitoring». As Kant claimed « the mind’s power of producing representations from itself », and a power that results in various actions. That being said, most of us would think that reason is completely detached from spontaneity; but is it, really? Think about it. Spontaneity and reason are actually really close to each other. They come from the same concept. People are from time to time required to deal with situations. One is aware of a fact and decides to do something about it, take action. In that sense, reason and spontaneity are very much related. In both cases, whatever the action one decides to take, the person is still aware of the consequences of the action one plans on taking will bring, even though one doesn't deeply or thoughtfully think about it, someone is unconsciously aware of the outcomes. The only, and biggest difference between those two concepts is that, spontaneity, unlike reason, separates the consequences and habits, to just follow the actor’s first will, although there might be risks and repercussions. Or, as Angus Graham says really well; « to shrink from dispiriting reality and be seduced by the value of a vivid local awareness into welcoming some ecstasy unsustainable in fuller awareness of its nature and consequences. » So in that way, we can say that spontaneity is not completely an uncontrolled behavior. However, it is impossible to generalize that fact and some people might be more predisposed to unconsciously understand the outcomes of an action, as everyone has his own characteristics, not everyone falls into the same category.
 Some people are more spontaneous than others and that is due to multiple 
factors. We, as people, are taught to learn various basic things through our childhood, which will later give form to the cornerstones of our own person, to make ourselves different from others. We are governed by norms of conduct and taught really young what we should or should not believe, what is right and wrong to do. We are taught specific manners and morals, which differ according to our backgrounds and surroundings, and those stay embedded in our mental until we are confronted by an argument contesting  those beliefs or until we find other beliefs more credible. Therefore, depending on where we come from, which culture and environment we have been educated or grew in, and basically everything that happened and helped build ourselves, we are brought up either more or less amenable, to be spontaneous.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, spontaneity defer from one person to another for the simple
 reason that it is a characteristic that one might inherit genetically from his or her family. Thus, one is already conditioned to be spontaneous or not at a really young age and later develops according to various kinds of influence on spontaneity during the growth of the individual. Lastly, I can say that spontaneity is also affected by age in a way. When he or she grows older, the less he or she feels disposed to being spontaneous because of couple reasons. Age brings about more responsibilities which consequently, give less space to spontaneity. Moreover, by aging people have different needs and habits, as well as wishing to upholding their reputations, and spontaneity then if not used well or in the right amount, becomes more a vice, a flaw, than anything else.</p>
<p>Yet, as children, teenagers, and even young adults, being spontaneous is
seen as being a quality one should acquire. Why are we even spontaneous? There are two conflicting answers. One argues that an individual is more susceptible to being spontaneous if he or she is confident of and comfortable with his or her surroundings and therefore, feels like he can be more of a risk-taker, more impulsive than usual, because of how well he is aware of those risks and the consequences any action could bring. Or, on the contrary, an individual can be more likely to be spontaneous as a result of the constant pressure or insecurity one might feel in his or her surroundings and daily life, and hence, may decide that spontaneity is a way of escaping those habits and routine. Spontaneity being something so personal and so related to the characteristics of a specific person, it is very difficult to have precise answers and therefore both theories of spontaneity may be useful regarding different individuals.
 and that is probably the reason of why we are mostly really unaware of its meaning and function. </p>
<p>Even though we can’t know for sure, experts have analyzed, made hypotheses,
and come up with theories which help us understand the term and concept of spontaneity, as well as its effects on individuals. For example, early Chinese philosophers and researchers claimed that spontaneity and happiness are very related to each other. With the support of modern science, this idea became more and more convincing. Reason and conscious doing prevent the acquisition of one’s happiness. That may make a lot of sense; First of all, self confidence plays a role. Self confidence is a huge part of one’s well being. It has a positive effect and decreases anxiety due to fear as well as self-doubt. Moreover, it increases your self esteem, which is well known to be psychologically important, especially when in quest to happiness; loving yourself, trusting yourself. For example, low self-esteem could result in lack of ambition due to the fear that success is unachievable. On the other hand, being spontaneous draws one into doing the unexpected along with facing, and possibly overcoming one’s fears. Therefore, it is possible that the more spontaneous you are, the fewer fears you have and the more experiences you can encounter. It works both ways, being more self-confident can lead to being more spontaneous and the other way around.</p>
 <p>Likewise, spontaneity has an effect on the feeling of freedom one might 
experience. Being more spontaneous leads to intensifying one’s sense of freedom in the way that we, as individuals enjoy the unexpected, the taking of risks, the freedom of doing what came first to our minds without the need to plan or reflect on whether or not it was the right choice. Thus that leads us, as humans, to be generally more open and less self-conscious, especially among other people people, as well as helping us to be more willing, perhaps able, to achieve our goals. That confidence and ambition gained permitting to be successful among others as well as with ourselves, which, itself, lead to happiness. </p>

<p>Spontaneity has a huge impact on people. Its significance is not 
taught enough, and we are not aware enough of the influence and power it has on people and on each of us, even though it should, and is already, part of everyone’s life. We should realize that being spontaneous or learning how to be may be a door to happiness, which makes it so significant considering that happiness is so important, and is what everyone is looking to reach through his or her lifetime. To conclude, spontaneity is something so essential to our lives and currently much undervalued by most people, due to the lack of knowledge, awareness, the lack of interest or due to the fact of the difficulty to find answers because of the really personal impact it has on each individual.
